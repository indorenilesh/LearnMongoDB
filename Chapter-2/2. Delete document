Delete document
---------------
You can delete document by deleteOne or deleteMany function same as insertOne and insertMany.
i.e.
db.numbers.deleteOne({"a":5})
db.numbers.deleteOne({"a":{$lt : 4}})
    Note : in above command although it matched more than one record but it will delete only one record as you are using deleteOne function.

i.e.
db.numbers.deleteMany({"a":{$lt : 4}})
db.numbers.deleteMany({})   ----> this will delete all the document from the collection.

Delete collection
-----------------
We can use drop() function to delete collection.
i.e.
db.numbers.drop()

Delete database
----------------
We can use dropDatabase() function to delete database.
i.e.
db.dropDatabase()
