You can not take backup of multiple collection from single backup at a time. But you have exclude option, so you can mention collection names from that DB, which backup not required, so it will
take backup of rest of the collection.

oplog option - in replication case, while taking backup this option need to mention, otherwise it will take backup od data which written on disk, but data available in oplog that time, will not get backedup.
while restoring again oplog option should be given if you have given oplog option while taking backup, otherwise it will not restore oplog backup.
