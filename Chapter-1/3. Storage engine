How Storage Engines Affect Performance
• Writing and reading documents
• Concurrency
• Compression algorithms
• Index format and implementation
• On-disk format

MongoDB Storage Engines
As of MongoDB 3.4, three storage engine options are available:
• WiredTiger (default) – with the option of on-disk/at rest encryption (Enterprise only)
• MMAPv1
• In-memory storage (Enterprise only)

Notable features of theWiredTiger storage engine that do not exist in the MMAPv1 storage engine include:
– Compression
– Document-level concurrency

WiredTiger Compression Options
• snappy (default): less CPU usage than zlib, less reduction in data size
• zlib: greater CPUusage than snappy, greater reduction in data size
• no compression

Configuring Memory Usage in WiredTiger
• By default, this value is set to themaximumof:
– 50% of physical RAM minus 1GB or 256 MB (for MongoDB 3.4+)
– 60% of physical RAM minus 1GB or 1GB (for MongoDB 3.2)
